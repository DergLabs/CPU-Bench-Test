# CPU-Bench-Test
This program runs a series of mathematical computations to measure the performance of a CPU. 
The execution time for each computation is measured and divided by the number of iterations that it is run for.
This score is then added and the resulting score determines the performance of the CPU. The Higher this number is, the faster and more powerful the CPU is.
